**LLMLingua-2**, Originally developed and implemented in Python by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/LLMLingua), is a small-size yet powerful prompt compression method.

- **Efficient**: Compresses context prompts with BERT sized models.
- **Accurate**: Achieves high accuracy then other methods while requiring less computational resources.

**llmlingua-2-js**, ported by [atjsh](https://github.com/atjsh), is a pure JavaScript/TypeScript implementation of LLMLingua-2, designed to run in web browsers and Node.js environments.

- **Performance**: Everything can be done in the browser. If your environment supports WebGPU, you can use it. Server-side processing is not required by default.
- **Correctness**: The original logic will be ported to TypeScript as accurately as possible.

# Try Demo Online (No Installation Required)

[You can try it on the GitHub Pages](https://atjsh.github.io/llmlingua-2-js) without any installation.

The source code for demo is available in the `examples` directory. You can run it locally using the following command:

```sh
cd examples/react-vite-webgpu
yarn install
```

# Getting Started

This implementation depends on the following libraries:

- [**@huggingface/transformers**](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js)

Especially, the `@huggingface/transformers` library utilizes various computational optimizations to achieve high performance. Please consult if the running environment supports the minimum requirements from these libraries.

## Installation

You can use the library by downloading the library from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atjsh/llmlingua-2) and importing it into your JavaScript/TypeScript project.

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install @huggingface/transformers
```

Then, install the library:

```sh
npm install @atjsh/llmlingua-2
```

## Model Selection

You can choose between models based on your needs.

| Model           | Size   | Pros                       | Cons                                   | Public Model |
|-----------------|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|
| **TinyBERT**    | [57.1 MB](https://huggingface.co/atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-tinybert-meetingbank/blob/main/onnx/model.onnx)  | Very small,<br>fast        | Lower accuracy<br>than larger models   | [atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-tinybert-meetingbank](https://huggingface.co/atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-tinybert-meetingbank) |
| **MobileBERT**  | [99.2 MB](https://huggingface.co/atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-mobilebert-meetingbank/blob/main/onnx/model.onnx)  | Small,<br>optimized for mobile | Moderate accuracy,<br>tradeoff in depth | [atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-mobilebert-meetingbank](https://huggingface.co/atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-mobilebert-meetingbank) |
| **BERT**        | [710 MB](https://huggingface.co/Arcoldd/llmlingua4j-bert-base-onnx/blob/main/model.onnx)   | Faster,<br>smaller size    | Lower accuracy<br>than XLM-RoBERTa     | [Arcoldd/llmlingua4j-bert-base-onnx](https://huggingface.co/Arcoldd/llmlingua4j-bert-base-onnx) |
| **XLM-RoBERTa** | [2240 MB](https://huggingface.co/atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-xlm-roberta-large-meetingbank/blob/main/onnx/model.onnx_data)  | High accuracy              | Slower,<br>slightly larger in size     | [atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-xlm-roberta-large-meetingbank](https://huggingface.co/atjsh/llmlingua-2-js-xlm-roberta-large-meetingbank) |
